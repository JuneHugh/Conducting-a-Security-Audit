In conducting this security audit, I used resources provided by coursera and Google, and referred to OWASP's security principles as well as the CIA Triad to ensure Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.  
Additionally, the NIST's Cybersecurity Framework also played a role in shaping my ideas and recommendations for Botium's faults when it comes to their shortcomings.  

Using the company overview and analyzing the scope and risks of Botium, I completed a checklist that Botium violated to help IT specialists visualize what needed to be worked on.  
Then, I gave special recommendations as to how they could address these issues.
