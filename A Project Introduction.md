# A Project Introduction

In part one of this activity, I will conduct an **internal security audit**, which I can include in my cybersecurity portfolio.  
To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating my portfolio, I will read Create a cybersecurity portfolio.  

As a reminder, audits help ensure that security checks are made to monitor for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organizationâ€™s business continuity and critical assets.  

I will complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on.  
The next course item will provide me with a completed exemplar to compare to my own work.
